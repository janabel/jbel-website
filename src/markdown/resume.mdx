## Work Experience

- **Community Privacy Residency**  
  Co-founder & co-organizer  
  _November 2024 -- March 2025_  
  _Remote & Taipei, Taiwan_

  - Co-founded and co-organized the \href{https://community-privacy.github.io/}{\underline{Community Privacy Residency}}, a 2-4 week residency bringing together 43 cryptographers, developers, designers, community organizers and activists from 15 countries to research, co-design, and build privacy infrastructure. Applied for grants, booked physical spaces, designed programming and community events, and led finances and operations all in the span of late November to late February. Ran first iteration of our residency from February - March 2025.
